The hidden résumé metric that predicts whether you’ll get an interview

Do you know that the longer a decision-maker views your résumé, the more likely it is that you’ll get an interview? Recent research combined eye-tracking and machine learning to understand résumé decisions better. The most actionable conclusion was that Experience section dwell time predicts interview invitations.

That’s next-level information. We’ve had eye-tracking studies for years. They tell us what readers look at, but give no additional meaning. Now, by applying AI, we know which sections of the résumé matter the most for getting interviews. 

I was a retained search consultant for 25-plus years. For the last 10 years, I’ve been writing executive and board résumés. When I did search, the first question I asked candidates after interviews was, “How long were you there?” That was the best way for me to know how well the interview went. Thus, it makes sense that résumé dwell time also predicts success.

So, let’s talk about how to make your résumé’s Experience section sticky to readers via design and content choices.

Eliminate Walls of Text

People don’t read word by word. They scan, looking for information relevant to their needs. Large blocks of text lose readers because they’re hard to scan. 

In How People Read Online: The Eyetracking Evidence Report, The Nielsen Norman Group, a user experience firm, described a wall of text as “a major repellent that instantly makes users think twice about engaging.” To avoid that, limit résumé text blocks to three lines, four if you must. Nothing else about your résumé matters if people won’t read it. 
Focus on Experience

Help readers navigate your résumé by providing clear section labels (Professional Experience, Education, Skills, Community Service, etc.).

Nielsen Norman also shared that many readers assess whether a page is worth any time in less than a second. They appraise before they even start the infamous six-second scan. Because the Experience section drives interviews, place it below the summary at the top of your résumé. You have to show your relevance immediately to earn deeper reader attention.
Use a Consistent Structure

Present your recent experience in a consistent structure. I include: 

    Company names
    Company descriptions
    The locations where my clients worked for companies
    Job titles
    Employment dates
    Job scope descriptions
    Impact statements. 

I always place company names and job titles on left margins to help readers who are scanning. They want that information. Give it to them effortlessly.

Also, lighten readers’ cognitive loads by separating job scope information and impact bullets. Describe scope in a narrative paragraph. Follow that with impact bullets. Don’t force your readers to do the scope and impact sort. They want you to tell them what your role was and how you performed in it. Make it easy for them if you want to keep their attention. 
Rank Order Your Impact Stories Based on Your Readers’ Needs

Identify a job’s deliverables. To do this, use job postings, talk with insiders, and ask AI platforms questions. Then, write your impact bullets to convince readers you can succeed in their roles. Let go of what you think is important about you; you’ll have time for that later. To grab and keep your readers’ attention, align your bullets’ content and order with their most critical needs. 
Provide White Space

White space makes résumés easier to read and understand. That ease increases dwell time because it makes readers more willing to engage. Use these minimum parameters:

    Three-quarter-inch top and bottom margins
    One-inch side margins
    Half-point spaces between bulleted impact statements

If you need more room, edit your content; don’t fudge the white space—you’ll lose readers.

When I see a crowded résumé, I think the person hasn’t learned what’s important to their audience. Because of that, they’re sharing everything they guess might be relevant. That erodes the likelihood readers will find what they need and, in turn, dwell time. 
Readers Evaluate Résumés and Make Decisions

I’ve talked a lot about readers here, but the reality is that the people who view your résumé are evaluators. They look at your presentation. Then they decide whether you appear to meet enough of their needs to merit more of their time. Make it easy for them to understand your relevance, and they will slow down to focus on you.
