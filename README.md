Optimistic students do better.

The students who felt optimistic and expected to do well on the test did indeed do better, on average, than those who felt pessimistic. All the students may have had some idea from how the term had gone up till then whether they were likely to do well or not. But, importantly, the optimistic students also studied more. They expected that their grade was at least partly in their control, and they acted accordingly. It became a self-fulfilling prophecy. It’s a perfect example of how optimism can contribute to success.

In a second study, the team surveyed 182 medical students about how they were feeling as they waited to be matched with residency programs. Then researchers surveyed the students again after they learned which residency, if any, they’d been matched with. Not surprisingly, those who felt optimistic that they’d be matched with their first choice were happier and less stressed than those who were pessimistic about it. The optimistic students were also likelier to be right. More of them got matched with their first choice than the non-optimistic students.
1. Start a gratitude practice.
2. Imagine your best possible self.
3. Surround yourself with optimists.

# Gratitude Transforms Our Physical and Mental Health [Link](https://time.com/7334526/thanksgiving-gratitude-mental-health/)

   When we focus on what’s right in our lives instead of what’s wrong, we quiet the emotional centers of the brain and strengthen the judgment and decision-making areas. In other words, gratitude helps balance our brains. Research has found that people who regularly express thankfulness are physically healthier, more optimistic, and better at achieving their goals. They sleep better, experience less stress, and enjoy deeper relationships.That’s not because they say “thank you” more often, it’s because they live with a mindset of appreciation. Gratitude isn’t just good manners; it’s good neuroscience. It shifts our focus from what’s missing to what’s meaningful. It reminds us that even in hardship, there’s something to be thankful for.

   Like all good habits, this doesn’t happen overnight. Gratitude is something we cultivate one intentional practice at a time. That might mean unplugging for a few hours to rest and reset, journaling about what went right in your day, or taking a moment to tell someone you appreciate them. These small acts retrain your brain toward positivity and resilience.It’s easy to sleep less than is optimal, eat in rush mode, scroll when our minds are tired, and assume that’s just life. But neuroimaging shows that those habits light up the worry circuits and dampen the reward circuits of the brain. I’ve seen scans where people are stuck on the “threat” pattern instead of the “thankful” pattern. To shift that requires intention and repetition. Every night, recount the things you’re grateful for. Over time, those nightly reminders anchor a healthier brain pattern. One that is calmer, clearer and more aligned.People attempt to fill their emptiness by doom scrolling or spending their money. But none of that satisfies in the way that gratitude does. When we take time to notice the blessings in our lives, or serve others who have less, our perspective shifts. The brain’s reward centers light up. Our stress hormones drop. We start to feel connected again.

Of course, the holidays aren’t easy for everyone. For some, this season brings memories of loss, loneliness, or unmet expectations. It’s easy to let bitterness or disappointment steal our joy. But the brain follows where we focus. If we dwell on what’s wrong, we strengthen those pathways. If we choose gratitude, we rewire our minds for peace and hope.

But, gratitude goes beyond psychology and touches something deeper in our spirit. This is why all major religions emphasize the importance of gratitude. It is not about ignoring struggle, but rooting our minds in something outside of our circumstances.

# Why Good People Get Betrayed: The Gita’s Harsh Truth
Betrayal feels like a knife to the soul, especially when you’ve done nothing but give love, help, or loyalty. The common belief is that good people deserve good treatment. But the Gita challenges this romantic ideal. Lord Krishna makes it clear: the universe doesn’t operate on emotional logic. It operates on karma, awareness, and duty (dharma). If you’re good but unaware, kind but overly attached, you're not protected , you’re vulnerable. Here’s why betrayal happens to good people, and what the Gita wants you to understand about it.

1. Goodness Without Discretion Is Dangerous : 
The Gita says, “Sammohaḥ smṛti-vibhrāmaḥ” — confusion leads to memory loss and poor judgment. Being good doesn’t mean being blind. When your kindness lacks discernment, you start giving to those who only take. Krishna never told Arjuna to surrender to the enemy. He told him to stand up and fight with clarity. Even love needs limits.

2. Attachment Blinds You to Reality : 
When we become emotionally attached, we stop seeing people as they are we see them as we want them to be. The Gita calls this moha (delusion). Betrayal often feels shocking because we ignored the red flags. Krishna warns: attachment leads to sorrow. Awareness protects your peace.

3. Expectations Create Suffering : 
Betrayal cuts deepest when we expect loyalty in return for our kindness. But Krishna advises Arjuna to act without expecting results (Nishkama Karma). You can love purely, give fully but the Gita reminds us that you cannot control how others treat you. Expectation is the silent seed of heartbreak.

4. Your Dharma Is to Be True, Not to Be Used : 
Many good people stay silent, hoping their sacrifice will change others. But Krishna never asks Arjuna to be passive. Dharma means doing what’s right for your growth, not tolerating wrong in the name of goodness. If someone repeatedly disrespects you, walking away is not pride it's alignment.

5. Forgiveness Doesn’t Mean Re-entry : 
The Gita promotes forgiveness, but not foolishness. Krishna forgives, yet never allows adharma to continue. You can forgive someone in your heart, but still protect your energy and close the door. Spiritual maturity is not letting someone keep wounding you in the name of peace.  
            _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________           

# Why the People You Help the Most Leave You First, Gita Explains
1. Helping creates bonds, but also imbalance
Every act of help creates a hidden imbalance. You feel invested, they feel indebted. One side expects loyalty, the other feels the pressure to return it. The Gita reminds us: any action tied to expectation brings suffering. If you want your giving to feel free instead of heavy, remove the “they owe me” clause. Otherwise, you’re not helping, you’re trading.

2. People cling to outcomes, not origins
Here’s the uncomfortable truth: humans attach to results, not to those who enabled them. A friend remembers the peace of getting over a breakup, not the nights you stayed up talking them through it. A colleague remembers the promotion, not that you helped prep them for it. The Gita frames it simply: attachment forms to the fruit, not the hand that nurtured the seed. It isn’t malice, it’s human nature.
Stop expecting people to archive you in their memory for what you did. Instead, treat your help like planting a tree for strangers. You may never sit in its shade, but it still matters.

3. Ego turns gratitude into distance
To say “thank you” deeply means admitting, I couldn’t do this without you. That’s hard on the ego. Most people would rather create distance than sit with the discomfort of indebtedness. So they leave, not because you weren’t valuable, but because their pride couldn’t coexist with their gratitude.
Don’t measure someone’s character by how they thank you when they need you. Measure it by how they behave when they don’t. If they vanish, it reveals more about their inner battles than about your worth.

4. The rescuer’s curse
If you always show up as the savior, you condition people to lean instead of stand. And once they can stand, they’ll often step away. The Gita warns: do your duty, but don’t mistake it for your identity. If your sense of self comes only from being needed, you will always feel abandoned once that need is gone.
Help people, but don’t become addicted to being the rescuer. Build your own life, your own purpose, so their leaving doesn’t feel like your collapse.

5. Detachment: the freedom to give without chains
Krishna’s wisdom is clear: act without attachment to results. Apply it here, help without clinging, love without bargaining, give without demanding permanence. That doesn’t mean you become cold or stop caring. It means you choose to give as an act of integrity, not as a transaction.The highest freedom is when you can look at someone who left, smile, and think, I gave them my best. What they did with it is theirs, not mine. That is strength no betrayal can touch.

# TRUST IN FAVOUR OF HINDU GODS-A tax unit [Link](https://www.incometaxparaskochar.com/resource/3TRUST%20IN%20FAVOUR%20OF%20HINDU%20GODS.aspx)

 - INTRODUCTION :- Indian public worship millions and millions of Gods and Goddesses and spend a huge amount for their worship and seva Puja. Every family worships his own God or Goddess either by constructing their own temples or without constructing temples in their houses. The expenses for the seva puja of Gods and Idols are not allowed to be setoff against regular income of the assessee. Contribution is also made for such gods by their devotees. The investment of such fund is also required to be made and income arising out of such investment is subject to Income Tax. Hence, it is advisable to create trusts for such deities and gods for the sake of proper tax planning.  


CREATION OF TRUST: - By making a deed of dedication in favour of gods and idols, trust for Gods can be created very simply and easily. Utmost care should be taken in drafting of deed of dedication. The settler can create such trust even by making small amount of gifts. Such trust need not be registered. The trust created for a family deity is not a public religious trust.
 

OBJECT OF TRUST: - The objects and purpose for creation of such trust is seva puja of family god, goddess, deity and idol etc, holding of religious functions and Ceremonies as well as maintenance of property, investment of funds etc.


WHO CAN BE TRUSTEES: - The trustees also called as managers or shebaits of the trust can be any major member of the family of the assessee. However, he should not be a person of an unsound mind.

SOURCE OF FUND OF THE TRUST: - The family members can make donations or gifts in favour of such god or idol for the corpus of such trust. Such corpus contribution made for such trust is not taxable in the hands of the trust. However, the persons not belonging to the family of the assessee can also make such donations and gifts for the corpus of such trust.


STATUS OF THE TRUST: - Such trusts are assessed as Artificial Juridical Person as per Sec. 2(3) (VII) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The apex court in official Trustee of West Bengal (For the trust of Chitra Devi) Vs CIT (SC) 93 ITR 348 (SC) 1974 has held that a Hindu deity can be in receipt of income which can naturally be taxed through shebaits who represent such trusts. It was also mentioned by their Lordship in the said judgement that the problem whether the Hindu deity is an individual is not likely to arise after enactment of the Income Tax Act, 1961, where in clause (31) of Sec 2 defines a person as also including Artificial Juridical Person. Hence, trust made for gods and idols shall be assessed as Artificial Juridical person at the rate applicable to individuals.

MODE OF INVESTMETNS: - The Private family god can make investment in movable or immovable properties. It can even make investment in Private Loans, Mutual Funds, shares and securities etc. There is no restriction on mode of investment of a Private family god trust like Charitable Trusts. It has also been held in The Official Trusty of West Bengal (For the trust of Chaitra Dassi) VS CIT (Supra) that the trust created for family gods can hold immovable property.

DEMAT ACCOUNTS: - The Bombay High Court has recently rejected a petition seeking permission to open demats accounts in the name of Hindu Gods Observing that deities should remain in temple and not in stock markets. While disposing of the petition filed by a religious trust, justice.

EXISTANCE OF IMAGE: - Existence of image is also not necessary for creation of family god trusts. Because Hindu does not worship the Idol or the material body but worship the eternal spirit of the deity in a suggestive or convenient form which is the image and therefore, the non existence of the image can not invalidate the endowment. The dedication to an idol is dedication to the deity who is ever present and ever existent.

WEALTH TAX AND GIFT TAX: - As per Section 3 of Wealth Tax Act, 1957, Wealth tax is chargeable on certain assets of individuals, HUF and company only. The family gods are not covered by Section 3 of Wealth Tax Act and as such no Wealth Tax is Chargeable on any amount of assets held by such trust. Although Gift Tax Act, has been abolished but Sec. 56(2) (VII) indirectly has replaced gift tax. Section 56(2) (VII) includes only individual and HUF and hence such trusts are out of the clutches of provisions of Sec. 56(2) (VII) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. These trusts are also out of the preview of recently inserted section 56(2) (VIIa) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

BUSINESS INCOME: - Such trusts can also carry sole proprietary business and can also become partners in partnership business through the trustees or shebaits. The deed of dedication should specify that trust can do business.

CONCLUSION: - Those assessees who are very religious and are dedicated to gods and are spending heavy amount for Seva Puja and worship of family gods should create trusts for their family gods so that they can gradually create a good fund for future worship of such gods and the expenses incurred for the seva puja of family gods can be properly accounted for. There is no control of income tax department as regards investment, spending of income or registration of such trusts as in case of Charitable Trust.
